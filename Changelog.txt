Changelog
---------

Version 0.9
- Single class named FileInfo.
- Implemented in PHP.
- Format filesize.
- Perhaps some other things, which I can't remember.
- Version was deleted, because PHP 5 did not support Unicode under
  Windows XP/7. PHP 6, which should add Unicode-support is not released
  yet.

Version 1.0
- Ported the class FileInfo to Delphi: TFileInfo.
- Added summary (count of key, total filesize, ...) to every
  page which contain keys (named section).
- Added logging-mechanism.
- Added changelog (based on a CSV-File).
- Added index-page with an hierarchic view of all sections.
- Added some basic replacement rules for filenames to support filenames
  with Unicode-characters (Freenet can't display such files;
  all characters in a filename has to be latin1).
- Added configuration file to read all options.
- Added CSV-files to read the keys of the freesite.
- Added generation of video-thumbnails,
  created with mtn (movie thumbnailer).
